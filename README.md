# WA2-webapp (With the much requested periods)
WA2 Webapp (Online personal webpage)
The inspiration for this wwebapp comes from 2 things:
1) The though about having your own internet "space"
2) A place where you are allowed to blog your daily life, with privacy

The webapp has quite a simple design. Specifically, you create an account, log in, and then start blogging away.

The website its built based on Flask and throught the use of a SQL daatabase.

Some of the challenges occured when trying to implement the login framework and through the use of sessions to keep track of whether someone is logged in.
It is also challenging to implement and use new modules, such as cryptography to store the password in the database in a more secured manner though password encryption.
You know what else is challenging? Deploying the damn webapp. The time taken for me to deploy the webapp is longer than the time for me it took to write the code.

One accomplishment that I'm proud of from building this project is to finally have a chance to go beyond the syllabus and actually successfully implement modules I've never used into my webapp.

I learnt that despite the many challenges I've faced in building this webapp - be it the multiple bugs in my HTML and logic errors in my python code, perseverance is what that is needed to be able to finish the project.

There is still a long way to go for this small privateblog website. One new feature that I've been thinking of adding is an AI chatbot. Unfortunately due to time constraints and my limited knowledge I was unable to implement that into my webapp.
The webapp could also come with a better design. Some of the boxes are misaligned and the textarea can make the user expereince unpleasant. Hence, UI improvements are also a soon to come update for this webapp.

Hopefully, you can use this webapp to the fullest, by writing and logging every single one of life's wonderful moments.
